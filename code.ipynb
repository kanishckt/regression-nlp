It is definitely one of the nicest houses I've ever had the chance to stay in! Anyone would be lucky to get the same experience in this great home, in a great city!</td>\n",

I look forward to a second stay some time in the future., What can I say that hasn't already been said about Kathie and Larry. It's all true! Great people, great room, great location and great city., We had an amazing time at Larry and Kathie's place. They were very kind and hospitable and really interesting people. Their artwork is all over the condo and I really like the style. The room was wonderful, the bed very comfortablle - and the view... breathtaking. We also enjoyed the pool. I can't wait to visit again., We had such a great experience at Kathie and Larry's place.  We had plenty of privacy, the view was amazing, and it's access to public transportation was great.  They were kind enough to make us breakfast and give us recommendations about places to go. There was also a lot of good pamphlets and maps in the room that we relied on throughout our trip.  We really enjoyed talking to Kathie and Larry about their life and the American education system.  We'd love to stay again., Wonderful hosts, wonderful room and an amazing place to stay.  The bedroom overlooks the city lights, is quiet and private, and decorated with the hosts's lovely artwork.  Thanks Kathy and Larry!    , Kathie and Larry were great hosts that warmly welcomed us and helped us in every way. We loved to talk to them in the mornings when we enjoyed our organic coffee! Our room was very private and everything was neat and clean. The view is amazing, especially at night. We highly recommend this place!, We can't think of any reason to stay anywhere else next time we're in Toronto!  Except maybe if there's no room at the inn...\\r&lt;br/&gt;We enjoyed our stay and our hosts greatly.\\r&lt;br/&gt;Quentin and Molly, Had an absolutely wonderful time. Larry and Kathy are the commensurate hosts.......showed us all the building's amenities and how to access them and even had lunch for us on our last day..........they were gone our entire stay! How wonderful!\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;I checked other rentals available in Toronto..........much less convenient, more expensive, hardly any amenities. Larry and Kathy's place is really the best value available. I wholeheartedly recommend staying with them.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Don , Had a wonderful time @ Katie&amp;Larry's! They made me feel very welcome. Easy going people with great hearts and minds. Lovely people! I can only recommend you to stay at their place!\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;, WONDERFULL couple, fantasic room. You guys made me feel at home. Kathy is AWESOME (and so are you Larry). The room overseas the CN tower, its private and comfy, occupies everything you should need even if you werent thinking of it. Thanks for a terrific breakfast and time spent. Located conviniently at the harbour, parking was a life saver!!!! The subway and streetcar is at your door no worries and your in walking distance of several restaurants. This would be my first choice no matter what! \\r&lt;br/&gt;Cant wait to spend time with you guys again! See you soon., Larry and Kathy - had a great time.  Thanks for opening your home to us.  Everything was exactly as stated.  Easy to find, perfect waterfront location for us.  Would recommend to everyone and would love to book again in future.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Donna and Dennis\\r&lt;br/&gt;July 9/10, Kathie and Larry are welomeing, intelligent, charming hosts. Their suite is private, soundproof, comfortable and has a terrific view of Toronto at night--buildings lit up and the CN Tower changing colours. Wonderful. The apartment is very close to the subway, a streetcar runs on one side of the apartment and a park and the waterfront are on the other side. All in all, a great place to stay, filled with their artistic talents.! RA, Kathie and Larry were absolutely tremendous. Their home was in a perfect location overlooking the wonderful Toronto skyline and Lake Ontario. They were warm, welcoming, interesting and full of information on Toronto. We loved staying with them and plan on doing so every time we go back to Toronto!!! I recommend their home highly! Thanks Kathie and Larry you guys were great and sorry it took me so long to post our review!!!, I stayed at the Harbour Front Room with my friend Jessica for 2 nights. Our experience was so perfect I honestly have nothing negative to say! Everything surpassed our expectations. The room was super clean, cozy and quiet. The view was to die for. Harbour Square was so conveniently situated I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a place to stay in Toronto.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Kathie and Larry were absolutely delightful! They treated us with such a warm welcome that we felt at home the minute we walked in (and so did the gnomes).\\r&lt;br/&gt;Thank you Kathie and Larry for the wonderful experience! , What a beautiful couple.  Kathie and Larry were so generous and welcoming to us during our stay, we just loved staying with them.  The room is great, very clean and has a great view of the city.  They have thought of everything, would stay with them again in a snap.  Thanks!, We had a fabulous time with Larry and Kathie on our first visit to Toronto. Great conversation and plenty of chuckles with entertaining artists over scrumptious homemade granola looking out to the sparkling Toronto harbor. What more could you want?\\r&lt;br/&gt;A private bedroom with ensuite and convenient security parking. These two are born hosts, very helpful in planning my photo and food tour of the city and I hope to visit them again. , Nice clean comfortable room in a fantastic safe neighborhood and very friendly host.  I highly recommend this place. :D, Kathie, Larry, and their home were awesome. \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Kathie and Larry were incredibly kind and gracious to my boyfriend and me during our stay. They welcomed us, both exhausted after a red-eye flight, early in the morning, hosted us at breakfast, engaged us in interesting conversation, and shared wine and their art with us. Though they were incredibly engaging and welcoming, they were also thoughtful enough to not be intrusive. \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;As for their home, it was just what we could hope for: clean, comfortable, well stocked with all the amenities we needed (hair dryer, iron, bath supplies), and ridiculously convenient to some prime locations (we walked everywhere). \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Our only disappointment with our stay was that we were too busy exploring Toronto and having fun that we didn't get to use the sauna or pool. , Excellent stay.\\r&lt;br/&gt;The location was central and the view brillant.\\r&lt;br/&gt;Kathie &amp; Larry were great hosts.  \\r&lt;br/&gt;Enjoyed the breakfast coffees, conversation and hospitality.\\r&lt;br/&gt;Definitely recommended!!\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt; , I really enjoyed my stay with Kathie &amp; Larry. They are very friendly, welcoming and friendly.\\r&lt;br/&gt;At the day of my departure I could return once more to my room in the late evening to freshen up after a long and humid day in Toronto which made my following long distance flight much more comfortable.\\r&lt;br/&gt;The room is very well equipped and has a terrific view! Imagine to wake up with a view on an amazing skyline and the CN tower.\\r&lt;br/&gt;If back in Toronto I would love to stay with Kathie &amp; Larry again. Thank you very much for a very pleasant stay!\\r&lt;br/&gt;Andreas, Kathie &amp; Larry's apartment was perfect for all our needs. It was clean, well set up, very good location and great view of CN Tower from our room. They were very friendly and helpful. We would like to have spent more time there. Highly recommended., Kathie &amp; Larry Young are wonderful people. They are very friendly, laidback and make you feel at home. At the same time you have all the privacy you need. The room is very comfortable and clean and being on 18th floor you have view over the CN Tower. \\r&lt;br/&gt;I highly recommend staying with K&amp;L for all of you Airbnb users. , This was our first experience with airbnb and it couldn't have been better.  Kathie sent us detailed directions and ideas of things to do and places to eat.  When we arrived Kathie and Larry were very welcoming but clearly respectful of our privacy.  We got a quick tour of all of the amenities and then we were on our own.  We had a delightful breakfast the next morning filled with delicious food and wonderful conversation.  Kathie and Larry are the perfect hosts- attentive, helpful, kind, and only there if you need or want them.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Turning from the hosts to the place, I think it is fair to assert that this may be the best location in all of Toronto.  It is on the waterfront, right next to the ferries to Toronto island, a place that we spent half a day with a picnic and books.  Our room had a tremendous view of the CN tower and had all that one would need or want to feel pampered.  We walked everywhere from our room- along the waterfront, China town, U of Toronto, Kensington market, financial district, etc.  The pool on the top floor is another great perk that we enjoyed. \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;I would recommend Kathy and Larry without reservation and am already planning on returning next year., Kathie and Larry were great hosts - very accommodating and friendly.  Room was clean, quiet, and private.  , Kathie and Larry are very kind couple! They help me a lot in Toronto! Also, the place is so lovely! It is lucky for me to live with them in Toronto!, We loved our stay in Toronto, Kathie and Larry's apartment is overlooking the harbour and the lake, the views are stunning, the guest bedroom looks out over the city with the most incredulous view of the famous C N Tower , we used to lie in bed looking out at the lights running up and down it every night.Our hosts are very friendly and have a wonderful sense of humour and you could not help but like them.\\r&lt;br/&gt; They gave us lots pieces of information about the city and we were not disappointed with our finds.\\r&lt;br/&gt;We cannot recommend them highly enough. Hope to be in a position to visit again(if they'll have us)., my only regret with staying at Kathie and  Larry Youngs was not staying longer! They were fantastic hosts and were really interesting as they were both very creative. The room where i stayed was separated more than spaciously, with a fantastic view of toronto. The room had a separate bathroom and all the amenities one could ask for to feel relaxed. They were very warm and greeted us each morning with a kind hello , snacks and conversation!  i would totally stay there again !, Thank you soooo much for your hospitality! You helped make our Toronto stay enjoyable and easy.\\r&lt;br/&gt;Here at the things we loved:\\r&lt;br/&gt;  the location (walking distance to so much);\\r&lt;br/&gt;  the view of the CN tower from the window;\\r&lt;br/&gt;  our chats about Toronto, life, school, etc;\\r&lt;br/&gt;  the city of Toronto;\\r&lt;br/&gt;  your tips about what to see in Toronto;\\r&lt;br/&gt;  the coffee and bagels in the morning;\\r&lt;br/&gt; \\r&lt;br/&gt;Highly recommended! Next time we are in Toronto we'll definitely stay again!\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;, Kathie and Larry are Airbnb rockstars!  I stayed in their spare bedroom with an awesome view of the CN Tower.  The bed was firm and comfortable and I greatly appreciated access to their wifi/ethernet internet, en-suite refrigerator and en-suite bathroom (shower shared in adjacent bathroom).  Their building also has a great fitness center and a ridiculously clean laundry room on one of the top floors with a great view of the Toronto islands.  \\r&lt;br/&gt;  I was pretty busy on this trip to Toronto but enjoyed chatting with Kathie and Larry and learning about their work in art and film.  I mentioned to them about my love of bagels and was pleasantly surprised when I found that they picked up some Montreal-style bagels from St. Urbain bakery (St. Lawrence market, highly recommend) for brunch on Sunday.\\r&lt;br/&gt;  Their location is ideal, right on the route for the Airport Express bus to and from the airport, and a five minute walk north to Union Station where you can grab the subway to many parts of Toronto.  They also live just down the street from the ferry terminal to the Toronto islands- only a fifteen minute boat ride away and well worth checking out.  It's also worth noting that Toronto's well-regarded comedy troupe, Second City, is only about twenty minutes walking distance west from their place.\\r&lt;br/&gt;  All in all, I'd highly recommend staying with Kathie and Larry and will definitely keep them in mind if I come back to Toronto for another visit., Well well well! This has got to be Airbnb's flagship venue. What an apartment!!! And the hosts are as inspiring as the CN tower and Lake Ontario views from their balcony.

Our stay was very comfortable, the view spectacular, and the location could not be more convenient- walking distance to central Toronto, and trams at your door (the building's door, not the apartment door).

On one side of the pool is a view of the lake, the other side has a view of the city which is similar to the view from the guest room...awesome! My wife and I really enjoyed the late night swims (pool is open 24 hours). The subway is about a 10 minute walk from the condo, which can bring you all over town. And for those that use cabs, you can fetch a cab in front of the building with no problem. Most hotels charge $20-$35 a day just for parking, and parking is FREE when you stay with Larry and Kathie. I also want to stress how strongly we felt our personal belongings were very safe.

The location is great - walking distance to local restaurants, shops, bars etc. The building is very secure, and had good additional facilities e.g. free wifi within the apartment, computers downstairs, pool, gym, rooftop. We loved the apartment. It was beautifully furnished, it felt like a home away from home. The hosts were so helpful and responsive before and during our stay.

Everything was as described, looking forward to my next stay with them., The condo was beautiful and clean, great location.

Very clean and views of the CN tower and Rogers center make this short term rental ideal for the weekend traveler. Highly Recommended!, The unit is a great place to stay and is within walking distance to great restaurants and historical landmarks.   Thank you To Shannon-Leigh and we would love to stay in this unit again in the near future., Overall it was a very positive experience. The host was very helpful in getting me the information I needed, in terms of payment and meeting to get the keys.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;It was my first trip using Airbnb and I will definitely be planning more trips in the near future using this service.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Property was beautiful, perfect spot for our weekend in Toronto. During our stay there was a problem with parking but it was not the fault of the host and the host was very helpful in determining a solution for that problem.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;I would definitely recommend this property to anyone and I would be willing to deal with Zinnia Properties again., I had such a great time staying here! Location was excellent, the property was beautiful. And Shannon was an outstanding host. , Booked this unit for a birthday celebration and city fix. It totally lived up to my expectations. Shannon was a great host and sent a bottle of wine for my birthday! Great view and location. We walked everywhere. Highly recommend this unit for any length of stay. , The place is what you pay for. I was not impressed with the response from the owner after being told that I would be receiving a call back. The tedious process of providing deposits could have been arranged and made less confusing for guests. , The listing was accurate: incredible location and very clean apartment. There's also an amazing view of the CN tower. I stayed here with 4 friends and there was ample space for everyone. Our host was super welcoming however there was no wifi in the apartment for our first night there which made things tough considering we were coming from abroad. The parking was 9.95 per day in the listing but our host quoted us 15 per day when we got there. Otherwise, it was a positive experience! , We had an excellent stay. The room was comfortable, the gym facilities were first-rate, and the host was obliging and attentive.  I accidentally left something of importance in the room, and she shipped it back to me (internationally!)  I fully intent to stay here again when I next return to Toronto.  , Shannon-Leigh and Adel certainly ensured that my stay here was terrific: from arranging collection at the airport, and a very generous bottle of wine awaiting me upon arrival at the apartment - to a phonecall the morning I left to see how my stay had been, and again an arranged airport transfer. \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;The apartment was in the perfect location for this visit - super close to all that the entertainment district offers, and within walking distance to a number of other neighbourhoods. It is just as the images suggest - well-appointed, secure, clean, and both cosy and surprisingly spacious. The Murphy bed is a particularly lovely touch.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;I really couldn't have asked for better communication from these hosts - they were engaged, quick to respond, and enormously helpful at every turn., Excellent apartment and location beside CN tower and sporting arenas. Host was very accommodating and made check in and check out process very easy. Recommend this apartment highly., Lovely host &amp; great, very central apartment. Stay was clouded by unforeseen maintenance issues causing us delays/concerns initially but Adel compensated us for this, was very apologetic &amp; helpful. , Great experience.  Walking distance to many great restaurants.  Check in and check out was efficient.  Highly recommend! , The location is great and the hosts were very nice. The address listed on the website isn't correct (it's the address for the Marriott) but the apartment is literally across the street so it wasn't a problem. The space was otherwise as listed and pictured in the ad. While I never met Adel, Shannon was more than helpful with my check in. I was unfortunately over an hour late due to traffic from a Blue Jays game but she was very patient and helped answer all the questions I had. They also gave me an extra hour to check out even though I didn't need it and a complimentary bottle of wine. If I am ever in Toronto again I will likely choose this place again. , When working with Adel's team, Shannon was outstanding! My fiancee and I had to make last minute adjustments and we were accommodated the whole way through. The unit was very well equipped from bedding to the kitchen and the space was very quiet. This was ideal considering the amount work I was doing remotely. The gym was excellent and the location is as central as it can get if you're needing to be close to the financial district.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;I'd highly recommend the World Class and look forward to staying again with Shannon. , Except for check in, I enjoyed my stay at Adel's Apartment. Adel was out of town during my stay and the apartment was not ready for check in as agreed at 6 pm. She showed great concern and promised to take measures for future Airbnb customers.The apartment is very nice, fully equipped, comfortable, well located in downtown, with gym access., The space was fantastic and appears exactly as it is portrayed. I would certainly stay here again!, The Location of this property was great. Close to great restaurants/shops etc. My friend and I made this late min booking due to her grandmothers funeral. Shannon was like a host we haven’t seen before. We had a little mix up when checking in, as the address was for the Marriott ( Right across the street ).  However, Shannon was amazingly accommodating and very patient with us. She went out of her way to meet us at a restaurant to bring us the keys etc for the check in. Which we greatly appreciated as it made everything very easy from there. The suite was actually very beautiful/well kept and very clean. Also very quiet. ( Which my friend loved the most )\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;I will definitely recommend this place to our friends and family. We appreciated Shannon and her compassion towards my friend who’s grandmother had just passed. \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;GREAT PLACE, EVEN BETTER HOST. 5 Star all around in our books.  , The apartment was very nice,  minutes walk from cn tower, metro convention center. The view from the balcony gets you Rogers center. Comfortable beds and couch for watching cable tv. Shannon was always available and attentive to everything we needed., I was really impressed with the apartment and the customer service that we received.

She was able to work with me getting in late on our check in date and leaving out early in the morning on my checkout date.  Getting access to the condo was simple and easy.  The condo was very nice and does have a great view of the CN tower.  I would definitely stay here again in my future visits to Toronto., Great apartment, clean, very comfortable with everything we needed (and more) to make our 10 night stay in downtown Toronto just perfect, The host was amazing.

I definitely recommend Adela's place., We were very pleased with our stay at Adela's. It is a full-sized one-bedroom apartment with lots of amenities - nothing bare-bones about the place. Comfortable bed, lots of plush towels and pillows, no shortage of anything. The location was very convenient for us. Adela and her associates were very attentive to our needs, including getting a needed second key. We'll be back!, The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting., Book this condo without a second thought!  It is a beautiful building and updated contemporary design.  We found it to be very quiet.  The bed was very comfortable and you can open windows for fresh air. &lt;br/&gt;You can walk to everything with ample dining options.  We would book this again when we need a place in the city and highly recommend it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cathy, Great stay in an excellent location. Nice balcony with views of the CN Tower., Perfect apartment, location, gym, kitchen, washer/dryer, simply everything you want., Adela's place is clean and stylish.

It’s got everything you would need for a long term stay and is well situated within the downtown core.  A short walk to groceries, restaurants, and the subway.

Public transportation is only a short walk from the house that goes straight to downtown Toronto.  We stayed for 9 days and we were very pleased. The apartment is tastefully decorated and looks like a five star condo. I highly recommend this place., Brent is a fabulous host!\\r&lt;br/&gt;I was in the middle of a move and needed somewhere to stay for a few nights and his suite was perfect. Outfitted with pretty much everything that anyone would want for a stay of any duration, I found myself wishing I had a few more nights in Toronto!\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;The kitchen is great, the combined washer/dryer was put to use and we definitely shared the back patio a couple of times; that's before the bagels and cream cheese in the fridge (that Brent left there in case we needed a quick snack, and the thoughtful, unprompted lending of his beach umbrella when my boyfriend and I were heading to Toronto island.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;I would highly reccomend this spot, only I'd really like it to stay open so I can sneak in a visit next time I'm in need of a place to stay!\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;For the price, you're getting an incredible deal. Get in while they still have spots available!, Perfect.  The price is right (free parking too).  The neighborhood is great with access to some excellent venues, yet close enough to downtown via the streetcar.  I got some of the best rest I've had in a while.  The apartment is very private, quiet, and well thought out. I hope Brent is still renting out his apartment next time I come to Toronto! Thanks for a great stay., The location was amazing.  A sports park right across the street,  24 hour transportation link, grocery stores and shops not a 5 minute walk down the street. One of the things we loved most were the restaurants that filled our location by Queen St, they are unique and very well recognized . Getting further downtown or to the beaches never took more than 15 minutes. Brent was a fantastic and warm host, you couldn't possibly ask for someone to make you feel more at home. Our vacation was lovely, would recommend it to anyone., La crème de la crème!\\r&lt;br/&gt;Great host, great location, you just want stay longer... Amazing backyard, to chill and relax.\\r&lt;br/&gt;Went for 3 nights in July 2010, the unit is awsome, quiet, private, near everything. Parking is easy! \\r&lt;br/&gt;Location, Location, Location :-) What more can I say! Book it.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Will sure go back for longer stay, enjoy ;-) A 10/10 , We arrived at Brent’s place tired and frazzled after a long day of driving. He got us squared away in minutes and sent us off to a restaurant in the neighborhood that he highly recommended. We had a wonderful dinner, which raised our spirits and set the tone for the rest of our stay. We were impressed with all of the shops, cafes and restaurants that were nearby. The streetcar line allows easy access to the most interesting parts of Toronto. \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Brent’s rental was spacious, clean, quiet and well equipped, exactly as advertised. Brent was very accommodating, well organized and easy to work with. His little list of things we needed to know seemed to cover all the bases. We would definitely arrange to stay with him again if we came back to Toronto in the future. \\r&lt;br/&gt;, Excellent ! Perfect !\\r&lt;br/&gt;Brent is a great host. He was helpful, nice and very welcoming. The apt is clean, beautiful.There is everything you need.\\r&lt;br/&gt;We fell at home. Our vacation was fantastic, we would recommend it to anyone.\\r&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Brent to speak french when we didn't understand anything., Thanks Brent! We enjoyed the stay in your lovely appartment very much!, Brent and Perry are excellent hosts.  The apartment we rented was immaculate and so conveniently located.  Next time we're in Toronto we will hopefully be able to stay there again.  They have made a delightful area of the deck.  It's really a treat to stay there.  , Thank you Brent. Great Place. Great rate. Very friendly and helpful hosts., Brent and perry and their cute dog was very welcoming.  The apartment lived up to our expectations and more, very homely and comfortable, it felt like we were living there more than just staying somewhere.    Brent and Perry are friendly but also gave us space at the same time and were very helpful. We would highly reccommend to others to stay at Brents as he is a great host!  We would definatley stay at Brents again next time we come to Toronto!!  , Room was great, very clean with all the amenities you could need.  We BBQd on the deck on the first night and it was a great atmosphere to just relax.  Brent made sure we had everything we needed and that we were comfortable. It was just what we were looking for. Thanks!, Great place, great backyard, great room, great BBQ and great little dog Mika.\\r&lt;br/&gt;Everything was perfect. My husband and I wish we were staying longer. Thank you Brent for being so nice., Located in a beautiful neighbourhood and conveniently at the corner of Dundas St E and Greenwood Ave, it was a short 2 minute walk to catch a streetcar downtown. Brent was a great host who was friendly, welcoming and really helpful with just about everything. He was always just a quick text away from answering any questions. The suite was perfect, very clean, modern, and nicely designed and furnished. Great shower and a very comfortable bed. If we are ever in Toronto again we will not hesitate to book with Brent. Great experience, worth the rate, recommended., Brent and Perry were excellent hosts and checked regularly to see if we were comfortable.  The apartment is well equipped, convenient and a welcome respite from the construction site that is our current home.  The deck was a wonderful feature and Brent got us set up with the BBQ the first night.  Great conversations in the evenings on the deck and a friendly pup, highly recommended! Ken &amp; Colleen, My partner and I were in Toronto for a stressful round of interviews and stayed in Brent's studio because we adore the Leslieville neighbourhood. It's truly the best way to experience Toronto as a liveable city and I would easily recommend this place. Despite the fact that it rained for much of the trip, there is a great deck and private outdoor space. The house is located very close to public transit, including the Queen streetcar line. Red Rocket Coffee is a five minute walk and a great independent coffee shop. \\r&lt;br/&gt;Brent is super accomodating and had us settled in as soon as we arrived. He allowed us to check in early and check out late to accomodate our flights.  He gave us all the privacy we needed, but is available if you need anything.  Great shower, internet connection, etc. \\r&lt;br/&gt;We overpacked not realizing that everything you really need is available - towels, extra pillows, even shampoo! , Brent was a fabulous host! Available, friendly and best of all lots of fun! We had a great time enjoying the peaceful backyard and the bbq which he makes available to his guests. Brent made sure we had everything we needed and did it all with a smile. \\r&lt;br/&gt;We had fun conversations and enjoyed sharing our evening with our hosts!\\r&lt;br/&gt;The studio is confortable and stylish, with everything you need in just the right place. You can tell they put a lot of thought into putting it together and it paid off. \\r&lt;br/&gt;It is in a great location, blocks from a street car that takes you to everything you may want to do and see in less than 15min. There is also a big park right across the street, with tennis courts, baseball fields, playground and water plays. Groceries stores are just a few blocks away and Brent will give you directions and help you find your way around or figure out what to do if you ask him. \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;This was by far our best airbnb guest experience. It felt like home away from home.  Our experience was first class!\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Toronto! \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for everything!\\r&lt;br/&gt;, We find Brent’s place to be a great base for visiting our family in Toronto.  The bus stop is literally right across the street and street cars are just a block or so both north and south of the house.  The apartment itself is spotless, even the top of the refrigerator was dust free.  The bathroom is small, but is of sufficient size; it’s bright and fresh.  In the apartment, you will find everything yourself would have provided for your own guests at your home; from DVD player and TV in the seating area to cook wares and utensils in the kitchen.  The wireless connection was excellent and I was able to work (yes, still have to work during my vacation) and also download movies at the same time.  All in all, I really appreciate the space that Brent put together for his guests and the thoughtfulness of providing everything one would need while traveling away from home.  Thank you., Brent was a wonderful host and the accommodations exceeded my expectations.  A perfect place to stay in Toronto: easily accessible to downtown through public transportation.  The neighborhood itself is great too!  , This is a great place to stay if you're visiting Toronto. Everything you need and very comfortable. It's a little out of the city centre but no problem at all to get there quickly - I used the Queen Street street-car.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;When I arrived I found out that on the night of my departure a big party was to be held there to celebrate a significant family occasion. Yet not once during the party preparations was I made to feel that I was in the way. In fact, quite the opposite, as concern was shown that everything was OK for me.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Brent! You couldn't have been a better host, going the extra mile., After bailing out of a horrible B&amp;B , we found this place. Brent was wonderful, he picked us up  in town and gave us a ride to his place, We ( my daughter and I) came by train to look at colleges. This was a great place in a nice accessible part of town He even gave us a ride.\\r&lt;br/&gt; to the subway station so we could catch out train home!  \\r&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Brent  :), Mon séjour de près de 7semaines chez Brent a été exceptionnel. Merci à Brent pour son hospitalité et sa joie de vivre. Rien n'a manqué dans le basement et si j'avais besoin de quoi que ce soit Brent m'aidait immédiatement.

The bedrooms were spacious and comfortable, with plush bedding and ensuite washrooms in 2 of the bedrooms. The living areas were stunning with plenty of space to relax, and the kitchen was fully equipped. The location was convenient and close to various groceries, highway and Yorkdale Mall. Despite construction outside, the townhome was quiet and peaceful.

I highly recommend this place. :D, Kathie, Larry, and their home were awesome. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Kathie and Larry were incredibly kind and gracious to my boyfriend and me during our stay. They welcomed us, both exhausted after a red-eye flight, early in the morning, hosted us at breakfast, engaged us in interesting conversation, and shared wine and their art with us. Though they were incredibly engaging and welcoming, they were also thoughtful enough to not be intrusive. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>As for their home, it was just what we could hope for: clean, comfortable, well stocked with all the amenities we needed (hair dryer, iron, bath supplies), and ridiculously convenient to some prime locations (we walked everywhere). \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Our only disappointment with our stay was that we were too busy exploring Toronto and having fun that we didn't get to use the sauna or pool. , Excellent stay.\\r<br/>The location was central and the view brillant.\\r<br/>Kathie & Larry were great hosts.  \\r<br/>Enjoyed the breakfast coffees, conversation and hospitality.\\r<br/>Definitely recommended!!\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/> , I really enjoyed my stay with Kathie & Larry.

Imagine to wake up with a view on an amazing skyline and the CN tower.\\r<br/>If back in Toronto I would love to stay with Kathie & Larry again.

It was clean, well set up, very good location and great view of CN Tower from our room. They were very friendly and helpful. We would like to have spent more time there. Highly recommended., Kathie & Larry Young are wonderful people. They are very friendly, laidback and make you feel at home. At the same time you have all the privacy you need. The room is very comfortable and clean and being on 18th floor you have view over the CN Tower. \\r<br/>I highly recommend staying with K&L for all of you Airbnb users. , This was our first experience with airbnb and it couldn't have been better.  Kathie sent us detailed directions and ideas of things to do and places to eat.  When we arrived Kathie and Larry were very welcoming but clearly respectful of our privacy.  We got a quick tour of all of the amenities and then we were on our own.  We had a delightful breakfast the next morning filled with delicious food and wonderful conversation.  Kathie and Larry are the perfect hosts- attentive, helpful, kind, and only there if you need or want them.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Turning from the hosts to the place, I think it is fair to assert that this may be the best location in all of Toronto.  It is on the waterfront, right next to the ferries to Toronto island, a place that we spent half a day with a picnic and books.  Our room had a tremendous view of the CN tower and had all that one would need or want to feel pampered.  We walked everywhere from our room- along the waterfront, China town, U of Toronto, Kensington market, financial district, etc.  The pool on the top floor is another great perk that we enjoyed. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>I would recommend Kathy and Larry without reservation and am already planning on returning next year., Kathie and Larry were great hosts - very accommodating and friendly.

Hope to be in a position to visit again(if they'll have us)., my only regret with staying at Kathie and  Larry Youngs was not staying longer! They were fantastic hosts and were really interesting as they were both very creative. The room where i stayed was separated more than spaciously, with a fantastic view of toronto. The room had a separate bathroom and all the amenities one could ask for to feel relaxed. They were very warm and greeted us each morning with a kind hello , snacks and conversation!  i would totally stay there again !, Thank you soooo much for your hospitality! You helped make our Toronto stay enjoyable and easy.\\r<br/>Here at the things we loved:\\r<br/>  the location (walking distance to so much);\\r<br/>  the view of the CN tower from the window;\\r<br/>  our chats about Toronto, life, school, etc;\\r<br/>  the city of Toronto;\\r<br/>  your tips about what to see in Toronto;\\r<br/>  the coffee and bagels in the morning;\\r<br/> \\r<br/>Highly recommended! Next time we are in Toronto we'll definitely stay again!\\r<br/>\\r<br/>, Kathie and Larry are Airbnb rockstars!  I stayed in their spare bedroom with an awesome view of the CN Tower.  The bed was firm and comfortable and I greatly appreciated access to their wifi/ethernet internet, en-suite refrigerator and en-suite bathroom (shower shared in adjacent bathroom).  Their building also has a great fitness center and a ridiculously clean laundry room on one of the top floors with a great view of the Toronto islands.  \\r<br/>  I was pretty busy on this trip to Toronto but enjoyed chatting with Kathie and Larry and learning about their work in art and film.  I mentioned to them about my love of bagels and was pleasantly surprised when I found that they picked up some Montreal-style bagels from St. Urbain bakery (St. Lawrence market, highly recommend) for brunch on Sunday.\\r<br/>  Their location is ideal, right on the route for the Airport Express bus to and from the airport, and a five minute walk north to Union Station where you can grab the subway to many parts of Toronto.  They also live just down the street from the ferry terminal to the Toronto islands- only a fifteen minute boat ride away and well worth checking out.  It's also worth noting that Toronto's well-regarded comedy troupe, Second City, is only about twenty minutes walking distance west from their place.\\r<br/>  All in all, I'd highly recommend staying with Kathie and Larry and will definitely keep them in mind if I come back to Toronto for another visit., Well well well! This has got to be Airbnb's flagship venue. What an apartment!!! And the hosts are as inspiring as the CN tower and Lake Ontario views from their balcony. Kathie and Larry rock :-), It was our good fortune to find this accommodation and these lovely people. Our stay was very comfortable, the view spectacular, and the location could not be more convenient- walking distance to central Toronto, and trams at your door (the building's door, not the apartment door).

Even invited to shared a breakfast with them. The position on the harbour was excellent. Basic facilities for heating things in the microwave were provided and when we needed to stay an extra day were able to arrange alternative accom in the building. We appreciated their help, Fantastic location & views. Kathie & Larry were welcoming & gave us great tips. Comfortable, clean room., I stayed with Kathie and Larry. I must first say I read all the re-views. I was impress.  I e-mail Kathie that I was arriving early she accepted my early arrival with grace. I was greeted at the door and immediately felt welcome. What transpired for the remaining of my stay exceeded my expectation. They were the perfect hostesses. They are engaging,\\r<br/>welcoming, generous and went out of their way to accommodate me and I was equally appreciated for all of their kindness and generosity. Thank you kathie and Larry. The accommodation was great the home was comfortable and the views were outstanding. Location suited my needs. I was able to walk to the Delta Chelsea which was what was important. Thank you. LaVerne, Our stay with Kathie and Larry was very easy and smooth.  They welcomed us warmly, the location was excellent, we came and went as we wanted  and we were very happy in their place.  We'll stay there again next time we are in Toronto, we hope !, Great location. Parking was essential for us and so it was fantastic to have parking included. Kathie and Larry are very nice chilled out people so it was a stress-free stay. You do have to share the shower/bath with the couple. Although it's not ideal, it was never a problem. Our schedules never clashed. Thanks Kathie and Larry!, The welcoming, generous Larry and Kathie couldn't have been better hosts.  They went above and beyond to make our stay in Toronto enjoyable.  The room was very clean and quiet.  It's great to wake up to a view of the CN Tower.  And Kathie makes delicious bread!, My partner and I spent three days staying at Kathy and Larry's home on the waterfront in Toronto.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The room was quiet and nicely furnished. Larry and Kathy were very helpful and cooked us a very nice breakfast (great homemade bread!).\\r<br/>\\r<br/>You do share the bathroom with Larry and Kathy, but this was never a problem.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Great views from your window of the CN Tower., I agree with all the other raters about this room - very comfortable and private, and about the hosts - interesting and helpful.  The rental includes a space to leave the car when it was not needed, and yet is within a comfortable walk to the Toronto Convention Centre.  Breakfast was provided on one of the three days I stayed and was a real treat!  On other days, coffee is available in the room, and there is a small fridge if you want to bring your own light breakfast on the non-breakfast days. The couch provided additional comfort to the room., Their place is very clean and comfortable. It also has a nice view of CN tower. Everything I needed was there, and the hosts were always helpful and kind. It was very easy to find the place, it locates at a good tourism area. They invited us to breakfast, we had very nice chat. \\r<br/>Thank you for everything, Kathie and Larry. I would love to stay again if I have a chance again!\\r<br/>, I was attending the Metropolis 2012 conference. Kathie & Larry's room was just perfect, being just next to the conference centre. The room has everything you need and a great view of CN Tower. I felt most welcomed and I am most certainly coming back., Everything the other people say is true.  Great spot., We had a great experience staying with Kathie and Larry. The room was beautiful with a view of the CN tower. The apartment is very centrally located, close to downtown and right on Lake Ontario. We walked all over downtown from the apt. There is also a fabulous pool on the top floor! This was our first time using airbnb and we will definitely use it again.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>We had a wonderful time getting to know Kathie and Larry a little better over breakfast. They made us a delicious and healthy breakfast that included: homemade sourdough bread, eggs, produce, and raw honey all from local Ontario based farms. , ...]  \n",

The location is great - walking distance to local restaurants, shops, bars etc. The building is very secure, and had good additional facilities e.g. free wifi within the apartment, computers downstairs, pool, gym, rooftop. We loved the apartment. It was beautifully furnished, it felt like a home away from home. The hosts were so helpful and responsive before and during our stay. We had to delay our check in date due to a flight cancellation and Shannon Leigh was really accommodating with the last minute change in plans. I would highly recommend staying at this apartment. We've stayed in others all over the world and this is one of the best!, Stayed at the condo over the may long weekend with a friend. The condo was great. Location was perfect, right around everything. Great place to rent out if you staying downtown Toronto., Ideal location and great facilities. Shannon and her team were outstanding hosts and were readily available to answer questions. Everything was as described, looking forward to my next stay with them., The condo was beautiful and clean, great location. Shannon-Leigh was easy to contact and made sure our stay was enjoyable and without any hassles. I would definitely stay here again., This is a great place to stay in downtown Toronto. Very clean and views of the CN tower and Rogers center make this short term rental ideal for the weekend traveler. Highly Recommended!, The unit is a great place to stay and is within walking distance to great restaurants and historical landmarks.   Thank you To Shannon-Leigh and we would love to stay in this unit again in the near future., Overall it was a very positive experience. The host was very helpful in getting me the information I needed, in terms of payment and meeting to get the keys.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>It was my first trip using Airbnb and I will definitely be planning more trips in the near future using this service.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Property was beautiful, perfect spot for our weekend in Toronto. During our stay there was a problem with parking but it was not the fault of the host and the host was very helpful in determining a solution for that problem.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I would definitely recommend this property to anyone and I would be willing to deal with Zinnia Properties again., I had such a great time staying here! Location was excellent, the property was beautiful. And Shannon was an outstanding host. , Booked this unit for a birthday celebration and city fix. It totally lived up to my expectations. Shannon was a great host and sent a bottle of wine for my birthday! Great view and location. We walked everywhere. Highly recommend this unit for any length of stay. , The place is what you pay for. I was not impressed with the response from the owner after being told that I would be receiving a call back. The tedious process of providing deposits could have been arranged and made less confusing for guests. , The listing was accurate: incredible location and very clean apartment. There's also an amazing view of the CN tower. I stayed here with 4 friends and there was ample space for everyone. Our host was super welcoming however there was no wifi in the apartment for our first night there which made things tough considering we were coming from abroad. The parking was 9.95 per day in the listing but our host quoted us 15 per day when we got there. Otherwise, it was a positive experience! , We had an excellent stay. The room was comfortable, the gym facilities were first-rate, and the host was obliging and attentive.  I accidentally left something of importance in the room, and she shipped it back to me (internationally!)  I fully intent to stay here again when I next return to Toronto.  , Shannon-Leigh and Adel certainly ensured that my stay here was terrific: from arranging collection at the airport, and a very generous bottle of wine awaiting me upon arrival at the apartment - to a phonecall the morning I left to see how my stay had been, and again an arranged airport transfer. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The apartment was in the perfect location for this visit - super close to all that the entertainment district offers, and within walking distance to a number of other neighbourhoods. It is just as the images suggest - well-appointed, secure, clean, and both cosy and surprisingly spacious. The Murphy bed is a particularly lovely touch.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I really couldn't have asked for better communication from these hosts - they were engaged, quick to respond, and enormously helpful at every turn., Excellent apartment and location beside CN tower and sporting arenas. Host was very accommodating and made check in and check out process very easy. Recommend this apartment highly., Lovely host & great, very central apartment. Stay was clouded by unforeseen maintenance issues causing us delays/concerns initially but Adel compensated us for this, was very apologetic & helpful. , Great experience.  Walking distance to many great restaurants.  Check in and check out was efficient.  Highly recommend! , The location is great and the hosts were very nice. The address listed on the website isn't correct (it's the address for the Marriott) but the apartment is literally across the street so it wasn't a problem. The space was otherwise as listed and pictured in the ad. While I never met Adel, Shannon was more than helpful with my check in. I was unfortunately over an hour late due to traffic from a Blue Jays game but she was very patient and helped answer all the questions I had. They also gave me an extra hour to check out even though I didn't need it and a complimentary bottle of wine. If I am ever in Toronto again I will likely choose this place again. , When working with Adel's team, Shannon was outstanding! My fiancee and I had to make last minute adjustments and we were accommodated the whole way through. The unit was very well equipped from bedding to the kitchen and the space was very quiet. This was ideal considering the amount work I was doing remotely. The gym was excellent and the location is as central as it can get if you're needing to be close to the financial district.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I'd highly recommend the World Class and look forward to staying again with Shannon. , Except for check in, I enjoyed my stay at Adel's Apartment. Adel was out of town during my stay and the apartment was not ready for check in as agreed at 6 pm. She showed great concern and promised to take measures for future Airbnb customers.The apartment is very nice, fully equipped, comfortable, well located in downtown, with gym access., The space was fantastic and appears exactly as it is portrayed. I would certainly stay here again!, The Location of this property was great. Close to great restaurants/shops etc. My friend and I made this late min booking due to her grandmothers funeral. Shannon was like a host we haven’t seen before. We had a little mix up when checking in, as the address was for the Marriott ( Right across the street ).  However, Shannon was amazingly accommodating and very patient with us. She went out of her way to meet us at a restaurant to bring us the keys etc for the check in. Which we greatly appreciated as it made everything very easy from there. The suite was actually very beautiful/well kept and very clean. Also very quiet. ( Which my friend loved the most )\\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I will definitely recommend this place to our friends and family. We appreciated Shannon and her compassion towards my friend who’s grandmother had just passed. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>\\r<br/>GREAT PLACE, EVEN BETTER HOST. 5 Star all around in our books.  , The apartment was very nice,  minutes walk from cn tower, metro convention center. The view from the balcony gets you Rogers center. Comfortable beds and couch for watching cable tv. Shannon was always available and attentive to everything we needed., I was really impressed with the apartment and the customer service that we received. We had a small issue with the sink and as soon as I called it was taken care of. Place was clean and extra bedding was brought to us the next day. Excellent location and perfect accommodations. Thank you for a great stay!, We spent an awesome night at Adel's place. She was very accomodating with the keys and with everything we could have need during our short stay. We really wish we could stay longer in this beautiful appartment as we really felt at home !\\r<br/>Location is ok, close to a lot of nice places.\\r<br/>Definitely recommend !, Great location (Everywhere was within half an hour walking distance) and a beautiful condo made my 2 month stay in Toronto the best! \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Despite being in downtown Toronto night times were peacefully spent on the balcony people watching :), Adel was responsive in helping to set up the details of my stay.  She was able to work with me getting in late on our check in date and leaving out early in the morning on my checkout date.  Getting access to the condo was simple and easy.  The condo was very nice and does have a great view of the CN tower.  I would definitely stay here again in my future visits to Toronto., Great apartment, clean, very comfortable with everything we needed (and more) to make our 10 night stay in downtown Toronto just perfect, The host was amazing. We never met in person but had great communication throughout our stay! Was perfect., This place is in a great location for getting around the city. The building is nice, the condo is very clean and comfortable.  Communication with the host was quick and easy!, Great place! Recommend it!, I stayed in this place for 8 weeks, and lived every minute of it. Close to everything one would need., Great location and spotlessly clean. Had a great time here, This is an excellent location both inside and out.  Inside is very spacious and clean.  The building is very secure but easily accessible.  Outside there are so many attractions and/or services within a short walking distance.  I would highly recommend this place., Adela's place was fantastic! My best friend and I visited Toronto for Labor Day weekend and Adela's place made our trip that much better. The condo is in a perfect downtown location with a great view of the CN Tower, from both the balcony and the bedroom. It was quiet and very clean. Adela was a great host. She greeted us with a bottle of wine and gave a long list of suggestions of activities, restaurants and nightlife. Everything she suggested exceeded expectations. I definitely recommend Adela's place., We were very pleased with our stay at Adela's. It is a full-sized one-bedroom apartment with lots of amenities - nothing bare-bones about the place. Comfortable bed, lots of plush towels and pillows, no shortage of anything. The location was very convenient for us. Adela and her associates were very attentive to our needs, including getting a needed second key. We'll be back!, The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting., Book this condo without a second thought!  It is a beautiful building and updated contemporary design.  We found it to be very quiet.  The bed was very comfortable and you can open windows for fresh air. <br/>You can walk to everything with ample dining options.  We would book this again when we need a place in the city and highly recommend it.  <br/><br/>Cathy, Great stay in an excellent location. Nice balcony with views of the CN Tower., Perfect apartment, location, gym, kitchen, washer/dryer, simply everything you want., Adela's place is clean and stylish. I would definitely return if I had another chance., Adela’s place is just as advertised, well kept and quiet.  It’s got everything you would need for a long term stay and is well situated within the downtown core.  A short walk to groceries, restaurants, and the subway. This place is worth it just for the view and the jacuzzi tub!]  \n",

Brent's apartment in Toronto. The location is ideal and the apartment is clean and simple. He was very helpful in advance of my arrival. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. , We just concluded our stay with Brent and it was great.  The apartment is very nice and very private.  Public transportation is only a short walk from the house that goes straight to downtown Toronto.  We stayed for 9 days and we were very pleased. The apartment is tastefully decorated and looks like a five star condo. I highly recommend this place., Brent is a fabulous host!\\r<br/>I was in the middle of a move and needed somewhere to stay for a few nights and his suite was perfect. Outfitted with pretty much everything that anyone would want for a stay of any duration, I found myself wishing I had a few more nights in Toronto!\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The kitchen is great, the combined washer/dryer was put to use and we definitely shared the back patio a couple of times; that's before the bagels and cream cheese in the fridge (that Brent left there in case we needed a quick snack, and the thoughtful, unprompted lending of his beach umbrella when my boyfriend and I were heading to Toronto island.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I would highly reccomend this spot, only I'd really like it to stay open so I can sneak in a visit next time I'm in need of a place to stay!\\r<br/>\\r<br/>For the price, you're getting an incredible deal. Get in while they still have spots available!, Perfect.  The price is right (free parking too).  The neighborhood is great with access to some excellent venues, yet close enough to downtown via the streetcar.  I got some of the best rest I've had in a while.  The apartment is very private, quiet, and well thought out. I hope Brent is still renting out his apartment next time I come to Toronto! Thanks for a great stay., The location was amazing.  A sports park right across the street,  24 hour transportation link, grocery stores and shops not a 5 minute walk down the street. One of the things we loved most were the restaurants that filled our location by Queen St, they are unique and very well recognized . Getting further downtown or to the beaches never took more than 15 minutes. Brent was a fantastic and warm host, you couldn't possibly ask for someone to make you feel more at home. Our vacation was lovely, would recommend it to anyone., La crème de la crème!\\r<br/>Great host, great location, you just want stay longer... Amazing backyard, to chill and relax.\\r<br/>Went for 3 nights in July 2010, the unit is awsome, quiet, private, near everything. Parking is easy! \\r<br/>Location, Location, Location :-) What more can I say! Book it.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Will sure go back for longer stay, enjoy ;-) A 10/10 , We arrived at Brent’s place tired and frazzled after a long day of driving. He got us squared away in minutes and sent us off to a restaurant in the neighborhood that he highly recommended. We had a wonderful dinner, which raised our spirits and set the tone for the rest of our stay. We were impressed with all of the shops, cafes and restaurants that were nearby. The streetcar line allows easy access to the most interesting parts of Toronto. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Brent’s rental was spacious, clean, quiet and well equipped, exactly as advertised. Brent was very accommodating, well organized and easy to work with. His little list of things we needed to know seemed to cover all the bases. We would definitely arrange to stay with him again if we came back to Toronto in the future. \\r<br/>, Excellent ! Perfect !\\r<br/>Brent is a great host. He was helpful, nice and very welcoming. The apt is clean, beautiful.There is everything you need.\\r<br/>We fell at home. Our vacation was fantastic, we would recommend it to anyone.\\r<br/>Thanks Brent to speak french when we didn't understand anything., Thanks Brent! We enjoyed the stay in your lovely appartment very much!, Brent and Perry are excellent hosts.  The apartment we rented was immaculate and so conveniently located.  Next time we're in Toronto we will hopefully be able to stay there again.  They have made a delightful area of the deck.  It's really a treat to stay there.  , Thank you Brent. Great Place. Great rate. Very friendly and helpful hosts., Brent and perry and their cute dog was very welcoming.  The apartment lived up to our expectations and more, very homely and comfortable, it felt like we were living there more than just staying somewhere.    Brent and Perry are friendly but also gave us space at the same time and were very helpful. We would highly reccommend to others to stay at Brents as he is a great host!  We would definatley stay at Brents again next time we come to Toronto!!  , Room was great, very clean with all the amenities you could need.  We BBQd on the deck on the first night and it was a great atmosphere to just relax.  Brent made sure we had everything we needed and that we were comfortable. It was just what we were looking for. Thanks!, Great place, great backyard, great room, great BBQ and great little dog Mika.\\r<br/>Everything was perfect. My husband and I wish we were staying longer. Thank you Brent for being so nice., Located in a beautiful neighbourhood and conveniently at the corner of Dundas St E and Greenwood Ave, it was a short 2 minute walk to catch a streetcar downtown. Brent was a great host who was friendly, welcoming and really helpful with just about everything. He was always just a quick text away from answering any questions. The suite was perfect, very clean, modern, and nicely designed and furnished. Great shower and a very comfortable bed. If we are ever in Toronto again we will not hesitate to book with Brent. Great experience, worth the rate, recommended., Brent and Perry were excellent hosts and checked regularly to see if we were comfortable.  The apartment is well equipped, convenient and a welcome respite from the construction site that is our current home.  The deck was a wonderful feature and Brent got us set up with the BBQ the first night.  Great conversations in the evenings on the deck and a friendly pup, highly recommended! Ken & Colleen, My partner and I were in Toronto for a stressful round of interviews and stayed in Brent's studio because we adore the Leslieville neighbourhood. It's truly the best way to experience Toronto as a liveable city and I would easily recommend this place. Despite the fact that it rained for much of the trip, there is a great deck and private outdoor space. The house is located very close to public transit, including the Queen streetcar line. Red Rocket Coffee is a five minute walk and a great independent coffee shop. \\r<br/>Brent is super accomodating and had us settled in as soon as we arrived. He allowed us to check in early and check out late to accomodate our flights.  He gave us all the privacy we needed, but is available if you need anything.  Great shower, internet connection, etc. \\r<br/>We overpacked not realizing that everything you really need is available - towels, extra pillows, even shampoo! , Brent was a fabulous host! Available, friendly and best of all lots of fun! We had a great time enjoying the peaceful backyard and the bbq which he makes available to his guests. Brent made sure we had everything we needed and did it all with a smile. \\r<br/>We had fun conversations and enjoyed sharing our evening with our hosts!\\r<br/>The studio is confortable and stylish, with everything you need in just the right place. You can tell they put a lot of thought into putting it together and it paid off. \\r<br/>It is in a great location, blocks from a street car that takes you to everything you may want to do and see in less than 15min. There is also a big park right across the street, with tennis courts, baseball fields, playground and water plays. Groceries stores are just a few blocks away and Brent will give you directions and help you find your way around or figure out what to do if you ask him. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>This was by far our best airbnb guest experience. It felt like home away from home.  Our experience was first class!\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Toronto! \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Thanks for everything!\\r<br/>, We find Brent’s place to be a great base for visiting our family in Toronto.  The bus stop is literally right across the street and street cars are just a block or so both north and south of the house.  The apartment itself is spotless, even the top of the refrigerator was dust free.  The bathroom is small, but is of sufficient size; it’s bright and fresh.  In the apartment, you will find everything yourself would have provided for your own guests at your home; from DVD player and TV in the seating area to cook wares and utensils in the kitchen.  The wireless connection was excellent and I was able to work (yes, still have to work during my vacation) and also download movies at the same time.  All in all, I really appreciate the space that Brent put together for his guests and the thoughtfulness of providing everything one would need while traveling away from home.  Thank you., Brent was a wonderful host and the accommodations exceeded my expectations.  A perfect place to stay in Toronto: easily accessible to downtown through public transportation.  The neighborhood itself is great too!  , This is a great place to stay if you're visiting Toronto. Everything you need and very comfortable. It's a little out of the city centre but no problem at all to get there quickly - I used the Queen Street street-car.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>When I arrived I found out that on the night of my departure a big party was to be held there to celebrate a significant family occasion. Yet not once during the party preparations was I made to feel that I was in the way. In fact, quite the opposite, as concern was shown that everything was OK for me.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Thanks Brent! You couldn't have been a better host, going the extra mile., After bailing out of a horrible B&B , we found this place. Brent was wonderful, he picked us up  in town and gave us a ride to his place, We ( my daughter and I) came by train to look at colleges. This was a great place in a nice accessible part of town He even gave us a ride.\\r<br/> to the subway station so we could catch out train home!  \\r<br/>Thanks Brent  :), Mon séjour de près de 7semaines chez Brent a été exceptionnel. Merci à Brent pour son hospitalité et sa joie de vivre. Rien n'a manqué dans le basement et si j'avais besoin de quoi que ce soit Brent m'aidait immédiatement. Le deck est superbe et très agréable les soirs d'été.\\r<br/>En d'autres termes, tout à été parfait et je me considère comme chanceux d'avoir été chez brent., Lovely apartment, in a great location with a very friendly and accommodating host.

The amenities were modern and the place was immaculately clean. The bedrooms were spacious and comfortable, with plush bedding and ensuite washrooms in 2 of the bedrooms. The living areas were stunning with plenty of space to relax, and the kitchen was fully equipped. The location was convenient and close to various groceries, highway and Yorkdale Mall. Despite construction outside, the townhome was quiet and peaceful.

Beautifully furnished with very good attention to detail.  The yoga room was especially nice and well equipped with lounge chairs and an elliptical bicycle for exercise. I can imagine how nice it must be to lay out there in the spring or summer. It was certainly a unique amenity and a nice touch. Board games are also present and another thoughtful amenity that the hosts included. Kitchen is well stocked and the appliances are top notch. Overall , the home provides a high standard. Check-in was super simple and quick.  My wife and I highly recommend this gem.]  \n",

We have no more than THANKS to Alex and her family. Best stay we had ever. \\r<br/>, We have no enough words to describe how beautyful and cozy is Alexandra's house. Every detail is tasteful and functional. our kids have been stunned when they've seen the toys room and tree house.\\r<br/>We loved this home as it if were our.
